Read Me: HiVolts Project

Aidan Lee and Kamran Bastani

a) Introduction
	
  The HiVolts class contains 
	
b) How this fulfills and doesn't fulfill requirements

  Requirements:
  
  1. Recreate the HiVolts Game that was created on the PLATO system (Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Operations)
	
	Our program fullfills the requirement because our game follows all the rules of the game 

c) Explanation of Current Errors
	
  
	
	
	
d) Overview of Code Explaining the Structure of It

	
e) Major Challenges
  
  Aidan's Challenge: One of the major challenges I encountered when writing up the code was the paint method since I did the graphics section of the game. When coming upon this requirement, I did not know a way to erase the board properly and I thought that the repaint() function would help clear the screen when the user lost the game and wanted to replay it. After a day or two, I finally figured out that I could use the clearRect function or fillRect function to block the whole screen with a black rectangle to cover the previous game up. I ended up deciding to use the fillRect function because I had never used that function before and wanted to try something new. Fortunately, I was able to learn something new from using this function and was also able to complete the task.
  
  Kamran's Challenge: One of the major challenges I encountered when writing the code was definitely the moveMho method since I worked on mostly the mechanics and logic of the game. When I first wrote the code, it took me a long time to think of the logic for how to move each of the mhos. After figuring out the logic, I was able to program each situation that each mho could possibly experience. From this, I realized that this was an extreme amount of code, almost 200 lines of code. I decided to generalize and use abstraction to shorten and simplify the code in a way to make the code shorter. After the use of both generalization and abstraction, I was able to code the moveMho code to around 100 lines. This was great for our code because it shortened our code a lot and made it more simple for a beginner coder to read.
